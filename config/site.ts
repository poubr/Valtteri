Making the games from start to finish, he does many things: writing, programming, graphics, animation and such. Music and sound design too.<br>The debut and magnum opus Rock 'n' Roll Will Never Die! (2022), is a musical comedy inspired by his love for heavy metal and 90s games he played in his childhood.<br>A new untitled project promises a cold-blooded, yet funny murder mystery set in Finland.<br>He's allergic to cats but doesn't care. Rock!",
